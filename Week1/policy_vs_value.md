# Policy-Based vs. Value-Based Reinforcement Learning

## **1. Policy-Based Methods**
These methods **directly optimize** the policy `œÄ(a | s)` without relying on a value function.

### üîπ **How it Works**
- The agent **learns the policy** that maps states to actions without using a Q-value function.
- Typically used when the **action space is continuous** or very large.
- Commonly implemented with **Policy Gradient** methods, such as **REINFORCE** or **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**.

### ‚úÖ **Advantages**
- Works well in **high-dimensional or continuous action spaces**
- Can learn **stochastic policies** for better exploration
- Often converges **more smoothly** than value-based methods

### ‚ùå **Disadvantages**
- Can have **high variance**, requiring tricks like baselines or entropy regularization
- Generally requires more **training samples**

## **2. Value-Based Methods**
These methods **learn a value function** (e.g., `Q(s, a)`) to derive a policy indirectly.

### üîπ **How it Works**
- The agent **learns the expected reward** of taking an action at a given state.
- The policy is then derived by choosing actions that **maximize the learned value function**.
- Commonly implemented with **Q-learning**, **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, and variants.

### ‚úÖ **Advantages**
- More **sample efficient** compared to policy-based methods
- Works well in **discrete action spaces**
- Often has **lower variance**

### ‚ùå **Disadvantages**
- Struggles with **continuous action spaces**
- Can converge to **suboptimal deterministic policies**
- Policies learned can be brittle and struggle with exploration
